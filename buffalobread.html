            <li>1 (8 ounce) can crescent roll dough</li>
            <li>4 pieces fried chicken strips, cut into 1/2-inch pieces</li>
            <li>1/4 cup Buffalo sauce</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded Cheddar Jack cheese blend</li>
            <li>2 green onions, finely chopped, or as needed for garnish (optional)</li>
